Run Command When Resource Pack Downloads

## Use:
Currently, lackin in features but in `config.yml` you can set *a* (yes, 1) command to run when a user first successfully loads your resource pack. This only happens on their first successful load.  
More config may be added in the future if wanted.  

This was coded at 2AM with copy and pasting galore. The code doesn't look pretty but it works.
